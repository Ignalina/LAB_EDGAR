EDGAR Log File Data Sets
EDGAR log file data sets provide information on internet search traffic for EDGAR filings through SEC.gov.  The data sets contain information in CSV format extracted from log files from the EDGAR Archive on SEC.gov, and the information can be used to infer user access statistics.  

There are two EDGAR log file data sets.  The first set pertains to search traffic from January 1, 2003 through June 30, 2017.  The second set pertains to search traffic from May 19, 2020 forward.  EDGAR log file data for July 1, 2017 to May 18, 2020 is no longer available.

Please refer to our List of Variables for a full description of the variables in each data set.  The second data set does not contain the same information included in the first data set because, among other reasons, some data is no longer available and some data is protected under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  In addition to the differences in the variables available, the second data set does not contain data from searches originating from SEC IP address ranges.

Additional data available for the second data set will be posted on a quarterly basis one month after the quarter ends. 

Further notes:

Given the large size of the data files, most of which include more than a million entries, users seeking best results should avoid using software that limits the amount of data that can be read.
The 2003-2017 data set does not have SEC IP addresses for some periods in time because at times SEC users were not routed to EDGAR the same way as external visitors.  For those periods of time, SEC IP addresses do not appear on the logs. 
Due to certain limitations, including the existence of lost or damaged files, the information assembled does not capture all SEC.gov website traffic.  In addition, it is possible inaccuracies or other errors were introduced into the data during the process of extracting and compiling the data.  The data sets are being provided on an “as is” basis with limited support.
A revision was posted on December 23, 2015 to include updates to the data from May 1, 2012 through September 30, 2012 (123 files total) which addressed issues with inconsistent IP address formats.
On May 16, 2017 the file log20121231.zip was replaced.  The replaced file was incomplete.
